# ShapeMakerProject
Repository for the simple project I've made to practice UI through the Java swing class, released under the Apache 2.0 License. Please feel free to alert contributors to issues with the current build of the program.

## Features
Current features include being able to create Rectangles, Right Triangles, and Circles and resize them using buttons built into the UI. Refactorings and support for other shapes are planned.

## Building
Simply clone the repo onto your own machine and start working or copy the source code into your own Java project.
